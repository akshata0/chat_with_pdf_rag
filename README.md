Ask Questions To Your PDF
I recently built an interactive web app where you can:
Upload a PDF
Ask questions about its content
Get accurate answers using Hugging Face models and FAISS vector search!

 Tools used:

LangChain (for PDF processing & vector search)

Hugging Face Transformers (for Q&A with FLAN-T5)

Streamlit (to build the UI)

FAISS (for fast similarity search)
